Frontend:

We will create the front end in React using hooks, such as useState, useEffect, useContext, useCallback, among many other custom hooks we will create. To make our application look amazing, we will use Semantic UI, and to help with the state management, we will use Immet.

Serverless Function:

Will be created using NodeJS. We will create a JWTÂ token and add grants to it before responding to the front end app.
